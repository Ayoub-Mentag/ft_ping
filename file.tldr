SUSv3 specifies\nthe UNIX (AF_UNIX), IPv4 (AF_INET), and IPv6 (AF_INET6) communication domains.\nMost applications use one of two socket types: stream or datagram. Stream\nsockets (SOCK_STREAM) provide a reliable, bidirectional, byte-stream communication\nchannel between two endpoints. Datagram sockets (SOCK_DGRAM) provide unreliable,\nconnectionless, message-oriented communication.\nSockets: Introduction 1163\nA typical stream socket server creates its socket using socket(), and then binds\nthe socket to a well-known address using bind(). The server then calls listen() to\nallow connections to be received on the socket. Each client connection is then\naccepted on the listening socket using accept(), which returns a file descriptor for a\nnew socket that is connected to the client’s socket. A typical stream socket client\ncreates a socket using socket(), and then establishes a connection by calling connect(),\nspecifying the server’s well-known address. After two stream sockets are connected,\ndata can be transferred in either direction using read() and write(). Once all processes with a file descriptor referring to a stream socket endpoint have performed\nan implicit or explicit close(), the connection is terminated.\nA typical datagram socket server creates a socket using socket(), and then binds\nit to a well-known address using bind(). Because datagram sockets are connectionless,\nthe server’s socket can be used to receive datagrams from any client. Datagrams can\nbe received using read() or using the socket-specific recvfrom() system call, which\nreturns the address of the sending socket. A datagram socket client creates a socket\nusing socket(), and then uses sendto() to send a datagram to a specified (i.e., the\nserver’s) address. The connect() system call can be used with a datagram socket to set a\npeer address for the socket. After doing this, it is no longer necessary to specify the destination address for outgoing datagrams; a write() call can be used to send a datagram.",
